Code Book:

This is the codebook for the dataset that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the Smartphone data obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository as part of the final assignment in the course "Getting And Cleaning Data" from Coursera.


Tidy data contains 180 rows and 68 columns. Each row has averaged variables for each subject and each activity.

Activity variable is factor with labels:

"walking", "walking_upstairs", "walking_downstairs", "sitting", "standing", "laying"

Subject variable is integer and all the other variables are numeric type. These are the total variables:

"activitylabel"
"subject"
